                    <p>Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean that is located southeast of India. The nation is noted for its broad plains, 
                        towering mountain peaks, tea plantations, and stunning temples. Ceylon was the previous name for the island, and the term is still 
                        used for Sri Lankan tea. Comparing to India, the nation is quite wealthy. Despite this, most of the population lives in poverty. 
                        Sri Lanka exports tea, coffee, clothing, rubber, and coconuts, most of their income is based on that. Tourist industry has been an 
                        increasingly significant source of finance in recent years. The island's attractiveness is attracting an increasing number of visitors. 
                        This is due in part to lower aircraft ticket rates, but also to improved visitor amenities.

                <br>
                    <p>
                        Since prehistoric times, Sri Lanka has been populated. The earliest human remains discovered there stretch back around 125,000 years. 
                        The Weddas lived on the island in prehistoric times. The Tamil gradually made their way from South India to the north of Sri Lanka 
                        throughout the European Middle Ages, where they created a monarchy in the 11th century. The Singalese, Sri Lanka's biggest ethnic group,
                        are said to have migrated to the island from North India about the 5th or 6th century B.C. They coexisted with the Tamils, albeit their
                        relationship was complicated and not always pleasant.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In 1505, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to land in Sri Lanka. Until 1658, they remained. The Dutch Verenigde Oost-Indische 
                        Compagnie (VOC) was established in 1602, and the Dutch sailed to Sri Lanka as well. The monarch of Kandy requested assistance from 
                        the VOC in 1638, requesting the Dutch's assistance in fighting the Portuguese. In exchange for an exclusive trade agreement, 
                        the VOC gave this assistance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka was conquered by the British in 1796, and in 1802 it became a British colony known as Ceylon. Sri Lanka gained independence 
                        on February 4, 1948, under the name Dominion Ceylon, which was renamed to Sri Lanka in 1972. A brutal civil conflict erupted in Sri Lanka
                        between Tamils and Sinhalese from 1983 to 2009, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.

                <p>
                    Natural vegetation comprises almost one-third of Sri Lanka's entire land area. In most regions of the nation, forest is the climax 
                    vegetation (natural vegetation allowed to expand unhindered). Tropical wet evergreen forest predominate in the lowlands of the
                    Wet Zone, while submontane and montane evergreen forests dominate in the highlands. In its driest regions, the Dry Zone features a 
                    climax vegetation of dry evergreen forest and moist deciduous forest, with forests giving place to stunted, shrubby, xerophytic (drought-tolerant) flora. 
                    Forests are few and scattered with grasslands in the Central Highlands' highest altitudes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The majority of Sri Lanka's climax vegetation cover has been severely diminished due to significant forest cutting for towns, 
                    wood exploitation, and agriculture. Only the Sinharaja forest and the Peak Wilderness in the southwest exist as substantial remains 
                    of the old evergreen forests of the Wet Zone. Most of the Dry Zone's woods are secondary vegetation that grew after hundreds of years
                    of clearance and farming. The variety and abundance of flora and animals in Sri Lanka's pristine forests is astounding. Indiscriminate 
                    exploitation is quickly depleting wildlife such as :

                    </ul><br>
                    as well as tree species such as ebony, mahogany, satinwood, and teak.

                    <ol>
                        <li>There are loads of new luxury hotels</li><br>
                            New luxury hotels are cropping up all across Sri Lanka right now, giving visitors greater opportunities to visit some wonderful 
                            destinations while staying in comfort. Tri near Koggala Lake and Chena Huts in Yala National Park are two of the most recent additions.
                            Also in Yala, the Wild Coast Lodge has recently opened.
                        <br><br>
                            <li>There are miles of unspoilt beaches.</li><br>
                            There are several gorgeous beaches in Sri Lanka. There's a stretch of beach for everyone, whether you're looking for tranquility, a party, surfing, or snorkeling.
                            The nicest beaches in Sri Lanka are found on the west and south coasts, with golden sand, coral reefs, and palm palms. Observe the daily fish harvest being pulled onto the beach by'stilt fisherman' sitting above the ocean. Galle, the principal town in this area, is a walled colonial city with a mix of Dutch, Portuguese, and British ancestry.
                        <br><br>
                            <li>Whales and dolphins thrive in coastal waters</li><br>
                            Seeing famous marine creatures in the wild is another advantage of visiting a nation surrounded by water. Watch spinner dolphins 
                            leap from the ocean off the coast of Kalpitiya, or visit Mirissa, less than an hour from Koggala Lake, to see the world's biggest 
                            mammal, the blue whale. In Mirissa, the whale-watching season runs from November to April.
