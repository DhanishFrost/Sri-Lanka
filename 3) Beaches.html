                    <h2>Nilaveli Beach</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        Nilaveli Beach is a wide, sandy beach with palm trees and fishing boats sprinkled about.
                        It's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee in the northeastern portion of Sri Lanka. Due to its own little reef, 
                        this tiny island features tranquil beaches with modest waves. Despite its size, Nilaveli's beach is popular with both residents and visitors.
                        There are lifeguards on duty, as well as several small eateries along the beach, the most of which specialize on seafood.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>    
                        Trincomalee, as a center of Tamil culture, is also a nice place to visit for sightseeing.
                        The majority of Sri Lankans speak Tamil, which is also the name of the ethnic group to which they belong. If Nilaveli's seclusion 
                        isn't enough, a boat ride to Pigeon Island National Park, just a half-mile off the shore, is an option. This lovely island is well 
                        renowned for its snorkeling and scuba diving, and there is an excellent diving school and a tour company that offers guided tours of the 
                        island near the beach.
                    </p>

                        luxurious rooms and services at a reasonable cost. The hotel features an on-site spa, two huge pools, and a restaurant, and guest rooms

                        <h2>Arugam Bay</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Arugam Bay is stunning, with sparkling white sand and deep blue sea that gradually turns green as you move closer to the beach. 
                            The beach is recognized as a worldwide surf destination because of its attractiveness, which includes some of Sri Lanka's top 
                            surf breakers. This reputation attracts a large number of people, but it also indicates that the area has an excellent tourism 
                            infrastructure and is easily accessible. The curving beach is reminiscent of a Hawaiian beach, with a dry, sandy part near the ocean, 
                            followed by rougher areas with plants and a tree line.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Mirissa Beach</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Mirissa is the major fishing port on the island's south shore, located on the island's southernmost point. It's easy to go to because 
                            of its beauty and proximity to Colombo (the capital city). The capital's airport is roughly a two-hour drive away. The little beach town 
                            and its wide beach are both lovely, with a dense grove of palm palms around them. The village is located on a little hill behind the beach.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Mirissa Beach is formed like an arrow, with the arrow tip protruding into the water. The surf is quiet and safe to swim because of the 
                            natural jetty. The sea is incredibly pure, and the beaches are dazzling white with smooth, fine sand. Where the bottom is sandy, it's 
                            bright green, and where there are rocks or reef, it's dark blue. Mirissa is also an excellent site to go whale watching, which is best 
                            done between February and March.
