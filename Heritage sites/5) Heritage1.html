                <p>
                    Sigiriya is regarded as one of Sri Lanka's most important historical sites. Locals call it the "8th Wonder of the World," and hundreds 
                    of tourists visit each year. It is undoubtedly Sri Lanka's most popular tourist attraction. The palace is situated on a large rocky plateau 
                    370 meters above sea level in the center of the island, between the villages of Dambulla and Habarane. The Sigiriya rock plateau rises 200 
                    meters above the surrounding forests, produced by lava from an extinct volcano. The tourists are astounded by the extraordinary synergy between 
                    nature and human creativity.

                        You stroll by what is known as the "Mirror Wall" just past the "Sigiriya Frescoes" – a wall polished so extensively that the king could see his reflection on the surface.
                        Visitors to Sigiriya Lions Rock have inscribed their names and remarks on the wall, some dating back to the 8th century.

                      <p>
                        "I am Budal [the author's name]," one translation says. Sigiriya was visited by a large group of individuals. 
                        I didn't write a poem since the others had!" There are certain things that remain constant. To safeguard these historic texts, 
                        graffiti is now absolutely prohibited.

                    <br>
                      <p>
                        A tiny pathway emerges at the northern end of the Sigiriya Lion Rock up to the enormous platform from which the location gets its name – Sigiriya (from sinha-giri) meaning 'Lions Rock.'
                        The two massive lion paws were discovered in 1898 by HCP Bell, a British archaeologist who was responsible for a large amount of archaeology in Sri Lanka.
                        A path ran between the Sigiriya lion's claws and into its mouth to begin the last trek to the top. 
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Apart from the initial steps and paws, the lion from the fifth century has vanished.Climbing to the top requires a system of metal 
                        stairs, however the original grooves and steps carved into the Sigiriya Lion Rock may still be seen.

                      <p>
                        After going through the gardens, you'll come to a stairway that steadily ascends Sigiriya Lion Rock. Some of the old artwork painted on the 
                        Sigiriya cave walls may be seen from one stretch of the stairs. These paintings are comparable to those from the Anuradhapura era, but the 
                        lines and shadows are done in a different style. To add to the awe-inspiring nature of these old Sigiriya murals, the originals are 
                        thought to have covered the whole face of Sigiriya Lions Rock, which is 140 meters long and 40 meters high.

                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Take a few additional minutes to gaze at the paintings and attempt to envision what Sigiriya Rock might have looked like thousands of years ago in all its painted splendour.
                        "The entire face of the hill looks to have been a giant picture gallery... probably the largest painting in the world," John Still speculated in 1907.
